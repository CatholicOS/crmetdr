The home of the **Common Roman Missal Editio Typica Data Repository** curated by the Catholic Open Source organization.

## What is CRMETDR?

The Catholic Open Source Common Roman Missal Editio Typica Data Repository provides a canonicalized list of identifiers
for all of the published editions of the Latin Roman Missal, whether the published edition is an [Editio Typica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editio_typica) or a revision of such.
